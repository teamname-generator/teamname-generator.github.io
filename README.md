# Teamname Generator

## Prerequisites

The Teamname Generator is a simple Javascript application, but I'm using [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) as the framework.  Technically, you won't need any of the following requirements to run the script, but you'll need them if you develop the application.

* [Bower](https://bower.io/#install-bower)

## Installation

### Clone the repository

    $ git clone https://github.com/dereknutile/teamname-generator /path/to/project

### VueJS Dev Tools (optional)

See the installation notes on the [VueJS Dev Tools Repository](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools).

### VueJS Installation Note (as reference)

[VueJS Installation](https://vuejs.org/guide/installation.html)

### Notes

This is a simple script that runs directly in the browser.  You need to point your browser to the file like this:

[file:///path/to/teamname-generator/index.html](file:///path/to/teamname-generator/index.html).
